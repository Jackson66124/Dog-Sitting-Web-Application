# Dog-Sitting-Web-Application
Full stack web application created for a dog sitting business with multiple pages for reviews, contacts, booking etc. Customers who use the website can visit the booking page and fill out a form including dates, times, contact info etc, which then uses the springboot BackEnd to send the customer information to the mySQL database through a post request. Other methods for CRUD operations of the database can be accessed by the host of the application. 

The application runs with a mySQL database on local host 3306. In order to run the aplliaction you need to have mySQL on your pc and configure a blank database to run on port 3306. Then clone and run both front end react branch and back end Spring boot branch.
